      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <Row className="fs-5">
        <p>Founded in 2020 by Giorgio Arnetoli, Alex Gunn, Sam Hargraves and Harry Clarke, Withington Hope
          Club de F√∫tbol are a men's football team based in Manchester, with Hough End our home ground. Created by four
          friends on a whim, the team initially consisted of mutual friends who lived locally. This initial recruitment
          process led to one of the core values of the club: if you‚Äôre not sound, you‚Äôre not in the squad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a suitably sized squad was constructed, the first hurdle was acceptance into a league. Aiming to play at a
          highly competitive level, the club eventually opted to apply to join the Manchester Saturday Morning Football
          League (<abbr>MSMFL</abbr>). Despite our newly formed status, the club was accepted into the <abbr>MSMFL</abbr>,
          henceforth committing ourselves to early
          Saturday rises and wasted Friday nights.
        </p>
        <p>
          The club's name has origins to the University days of the founders, who inhabited a house on Hope Street. As a
          newly created side, hope was desperately needed given the unforgiving nature of having various squad members
          who
          had never played competitive football before. Currently in our third season in the <abbr>MSMFL</abbr>, the team
          have improved drastically over
          time, leaving behind the ghosts of various double digit losses to now being a side competitive in every match.
          With an ever-tightening team bond, the club hopes to be competing towards of the top of the table in the
          seasons
          to come.
